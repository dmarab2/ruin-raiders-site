        <h3> Basic System </h3>
        <p>A character has four stats. These are Vigor, Finesse, Intellect, and Sense. These stats will vary based on what the player allocates points to during character creation.
Whenever a player wishes to do something with a chance of failure and meaningful consequences (for example, trying to hack a terminal to open a door before a swarm of creatures bears down on them) they must roll 5d6 and aim for numbers under or equal to the relevant stat. The relevant stat is ultimately decided by the GM.
Each die that rolls under or equal to the relevant stat is a success. A player must roll a certain number of successes equal to a number determined by the GM. The number of successes required reflects the difficulty of the task. The various difficulties can be seen below: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy: 2 Successes</li>
            <li>Moderate: 3 Successes</li>
            <li>Hard: 4 Successes</li>
            <li>Severe: 5 Successes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In combat, a player makes an attack roll with a weapon, and the damage done is equal to the weapon’s damage rating + the number of successes rolled, subtracted by the opponent’s defense. Rolling no successes means no damage is done.</p>

        <h3> The Four Stats </h3>
        <p><strong>Vigor:</strong> Represents bodily strength, constitution, and overall health. Use this stat for rolls involving melee attacks, feats of strength, resistance (i.e. holding your breath or resisting disease/poison) and general athletics. Your vigor stat is also added to your total Health.</p>
        <p><strong>Finesse:</strong> Represents dexterity, agility, and hand-eye coordination. Use this stat for rolls involving ranged attacks, feats of speed, stealth, and any activities involving precision (such as trying to pickpocket someone without getting caught).</p>
        <p><strong>Intellect:</strong> Represents knowledge, cunning, wit, and memory. Use this stat for working out problems involving logic, remembering information, identifying things, or anything that involves education. Also use this stat for persuading or deceiving others.</p>
        <p><strong>Sense:</strong> Represents perception, awareness, intuition, recognition, and sense of self. Use this stat for finding things in the environment,  noticing others (potentially before they notice you), reading people, and generally anything that requires attunement to the world around you. Also use this stat for befriending or intimidating others.</p>
